        <p>
            ANS - <b>ECOSYSTEM</b>:AN ECOSYSTEM IS A STRUCTRAL AND FUNCTIONAL UNIT OF NATURE.it comprises all abiotic
            and biotic factor
            <br>abiotic factor consist of all inorganic material -air ,water and soil</br>

            decomposer.</div>
        <h4>Ecosystems are classified as artificial or natural primarily based on the level of human interference and
            creation. </p>
    </div>
    <b>NATURAL ECOSYSTEM</b>
    <p>Ecosystems are classified as artificial or natural primarily based on the level of human interference and
        creation. Natural ecosystems develop on their own without human intervention, are self-sustaining, and
        characterized by high biodiversity for example-river,sea ,forest etc.</p>
    <b>ARTIFICIAL ECOSYSTEM</b>
    <P>artificial ecosystems are man-made, require constant human maintenance, and often have limited biodiversity. for
        example-aquarium,agriculture field,zoo ,etc</P>
